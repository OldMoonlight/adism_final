          <h2 style="padding-top:80px"> History </h2>
          <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Fyzabad Anglican Secondary (formerly Fyzabad Intermediate) is very much a community school. The school was founded as a primary school in 1941 by Rev. Harold M. Telemarque and Mrs. Waldron to cater to the needs of the children of the Apex Oil Company of Fyzabad. As "Inter", our motto was "Culture & Service" which is still carried on the school's monogram.</p>
          <p style="text-indent: 30px;">Today, Fyzabad Anglican Secondary is a seven year school offerring classes from Form One to Six. Presently we have a student population of about 600 with over 50 teachers and staff. Subjects range from the sciences, languages, social sciences, business and the visual and performing arts.

          <h2 id="school-pledge" style="padding-top:20px"> School pledge </h2>
          <p> "I shall consider my school as the most important thing in my life. I shall always honour, respect and obey not only my teachers and parents, but I must be polite and courteous to all people; even unto my playmates." </p>
          <p> "I shall never be afraid to tell my teacher that she/he is wrong when I am sure of it, but I would do so with respect and courtesy. I shall be regular and punctual and take a keen interest in all that goes on in school." </p>
          <p> "As I live all day at school, I shall endevour to keep it as sanitary as possible. I shall keep all my books in order, but pay special attention to my exercise books as they are the products of my creation." </p>
          <p> "I shall endevour to do well here, that I shall be remembered for my diligence, courtesy and devotion to my duty and I shall have my school the better for my being in it." </p>
        
        
          <h2 id="house-system" style="padding-top:20px"> House System </h2>
          <p style="text-indent: 30px;"> Here at FASS, we have a House System which is used to bring about friendly competition in the spirit of togetherness at the school, while giving students from different forms the opportunity to work in teams, and providing leadership opportunities.</p>
          <p style="text-indent: 30px;"> There are six houses named after past students. You will be assigned to a House during the first week of school, and you are expected to participate fully in all House activities. The Houses and their respective colours are: </p>
          <span style="color: #add8e6; font-weight: bold;"> ALLUM (light blue)</span>,
          <span style="color: #FF0000; font-weight: bold;"> BALLAH (red)</span>,
          <span style="color: #800080; font-weight: bold;"> CAMPBELL (purple)</span>,
          <span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold;"> MILLETTE (dark blue)</span>,
          <span style="color: #32CD32; font-weight: bold;"> OCEAN (green)</span>, and
          <span style="color: #FFA500; font-weight: bold;"> TAYLOR-CELESTINE (orange)</span>
          <p style="text-indent: 30px;"> Formal house meetings are held during school time, but house captains are free to call meetings during lunchtime or breaktime. Please ensure that you are attend and support your House. </p>
        
        
          <h2 id="school-rules" style="padding-top:20px"> School Rules </h2>
          <p style="text-indent: 30px;"> At Fyzabad Anglican Secondary, we expect our students to be honest and well-disciplined. There is a lot of emphasis placed on obeying the school rules, and anyone found breaking these rules will find him/herself answering to the Deans. </p>
          <p style="text-indent: 30px;"> These rules can be found inside your homework notebook. In this notebook you are expected to record all homework assigned, and have your parents sign it every night upon completion of said work. Your teachers can ask for this book at any time. You will also write your own class rules and determine the consequences for breaking them. The official school rules include: </p>
          <ol style="padding-bottom: 40px">
            <li> School calls at 8:10am with an earper bell at 8:05am. You are expected to be regular and punctual. </li>
            <li> All students are expected to have and bring to school all the books on their bookpst.
            A six-day timetable will be provided to guide you on the first day. </li>
            <li> All written communication between the school and your parent/guardian will be by means of the homework notebook â€”
            excuses, reasons for unpunctuapty, not wearing the full uniform, etc. </li>
            <li> All students are expected to be in full uniform at all times.
            Please note that girls must wear all-white shoes, and boys all-black shoes. 
            You will also have a P.E. uniform to be brought to school on the day assigned to the subject. </li>
            <li> You are to wear no jewellery, except for watches, and for girls, stopper earrings.
            Offending jewellery will be confiscated by the teachers or school prefects and held until the end of the school term. </li>
